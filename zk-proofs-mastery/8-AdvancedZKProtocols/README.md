## üîÆ 1. PLONK: Universal SNARKs

PLONK (Permutations over Lagrange-bases for Oecumenical Noninteractive arguments of Knowledge) represents a significant advancement in SNARK technology.

### Key Innovations

#### Universal Setup
```
Traditional SNARKs: Circuit-specific trusted setup required
PLONK: Single universal setup works for all circuits up to size N
```

#### Polynomial Commitment Schemes
- **KZG Commitments**: Efficient polynomial commitments using bilinear pairings
- **Batch Opening**: Verify multiple polynomial evaluations simultaneously
- **Constant-Size Proofs**: Proofs remain O(1) regardless of circuit complexity

### PLONK Protocol Components

#### 1. Arithmetic Circuits as Polynomials
```
Circuit Gates ‚Üí Polynomial Constraints
- Addition gates: qa(X) ¬∑ a(X) + qb(X) ¬∑ b(X) + qc(X) ¬∑ c(X) = 0
- Multiplication gates: qa(X) ¬∑ a(X) ¬∑ b(X) + qb(X) ¬∑ b(X) + qc(X) ¬∑ c(X) = 0
- Custom gates: User-defined polynomial relations
```

#### 2. Copy Constraints via Permutations
```
Wire Connections ‚Üí Permutation Arguments

- Grand Product: Ensures consistent values across connected wires
- Plookup: Efficient lookup arguments for table constraints
```

#### 3. Polynomial Commitment Flow
```
1. Prover commits to wire polynomials: [a(X)], [b(X)], [c(X)]
2. Verifier sends random challenges: Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥
3. Prover computes quotient polynomial: t(X)
4. Batch opening at evaluation point: Œ∂
5. Verification via pairing equations
```

### Advanced PLONK Features

```

```

### Range Proof Construction

Polynomial: (b_i)(b_i - 1) = 0 for all i
Vector Form: aL ‚äô (aL - 1^n) = 0^n
```

```

#### Applications

  C = C‚ÇÅ + r¬≤¬∑C‚ÇÇ
```
