    "\n",
    "1.  **What is a Coin?**\n",
    "    A \"coin\" is defined as a **chain of digital signatures**. It's like the history of endorsements on a paper check.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Transferring Ownership:**\n",
    "    To send a coin to Alice, the current owner signs a hash of the previous transaction and Alice's public key. This new transaction is added to the end of the coin's chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Verification:**\n",
    "    Anyone can check the chain of signatures to verify the coin's legitimate history.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Big Problem: Double-Spending\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it's all digital, what stops the owner from sending the same coin to two different people (e.g., Alice and Bob)? This is the **double-spending problem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution (Introduction)\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent double-spending, the network needs a way to agree on a **single, shared history of transactions**. The paper proposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  All transactions must be **publicly announced**.\n",
    "2.  The network needs a system to agree on the **order** in which transactions were received.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sets the stage for the Timestamp Server and Proof-of-Work."

    "## Page 3: Timestamp Server\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to the double-spending problem starts with a **timestamp server**. Its purpose is to create a decentralized, agreed-upon history of transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Hashing a Block:** A block of transactions is collected, and a **hash** (a unique digital fingerprint) of the entire block is calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Public Broadcasting:** This hash is then widely published, proving that the data in the block existed at that specific time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the Chain\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the key concept of the blockchain:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Each new timestamp **must include the previous timestamp's hash** in its own data before being hashed.\n",
    "*   This creates a **chain**, where each new link cryptographically depends on the one before it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure makes the history incredibly secure. To change an old block, an attacker would have to redo the work for that block and all subsequent blocks in the chain."

    "## Section 4: Proof-of-Work\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The Goal:** To implement the timestamp server in a peer-to-peer way, requiring the hash of a block to start with a certain number of zero bits.\n",
    "*   **The Method:** Miners must repeatedly hash the block header with a different \"nonce\" until they find a hash that meets the difficulty target. This is what `assignment3.js` simulates.\n",
    "*   **Difficulty Adjustment:** The difficulty is automatically adjusted by the network to keep the average time between new blocks at around 10 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 5: The Network\n",
    "\n",
    "The step-by-step process of how the network operates:\n",
    "1.  New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.\n",
    "2.  Each node collects new transactions into a block.\n",
    "3.  Each node works on finding the difficult proof-of-work for its block.\n",
    "4.  When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all other nodes.\n",
    "5.  Nodes only accept the block if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.\n",
    "6.  Nodes show they accept the block by starting to work on the *next* block, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash. The longest chain is always considered the correct one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 6: Incentive\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Why Participate?**\n",
    "    1.  **Block Reward:** The creator of a block gets a reward of new coins.\n",
    "    2.  **Transaction Fees:** The creator also gets to keep any transaction fees from the transactions within that block.\n",
    "*   **The Result:** This encourages honest participation and secures the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 7: Reclaiming Disk Space\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The Problem:** Storing every transaction forever would make the blockchain enormous.\n",
    "*   **The Solution (Merkle Trees):** Once transactions are buried deep enough, they can be discarded. Only the block header, containing the **root hash** of a Merkle Tree of all the block's transactions, needs to be kept.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 8: Simplified Payment Verification (SPV)\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The Concept:** It's possible to verify payments without running a full network node.\n",
    "*   **How it Works:** An SPV client downloads only the **block headers**. It can then ask the network for the Merkle branch that links a specific transaction to its place in a block, providing cryptographic proof of its existence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 9: Combining and Splitting Value\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Combining:** A transaction can have multiple inputs to combine smaller amounts.\n",
    "*   **Splitting:** A transaction typically has two outputs: one for the payment and one that sends the \"change\" back to the sender using a new address.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 10: Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How it Works:** The network is **pseudonymous**, not anonymous. Public keys are not directly linked to real-world identities.\n",
    "*   **The Catch:** All transactions are public. If a key is linked to a person, all their transactions can be traced.\n",
    "*   **The Recommendation:** Use a new key pair for every transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 11: Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "This section provides a statistical analysis showing that the probability of an attacker successfully creating an alternative, longer chain decreases exponentially as more blocks are added to the honest chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 12: Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "A summary of the system: a trustless, peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is secure as long as honest nodes control the majority of CPU power."
