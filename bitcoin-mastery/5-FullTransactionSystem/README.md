# Module 5: Full Transaction System

## Concept

This module combines everything learned so far into a complete Bitcoin-like system with:

-   **UTXO Model:** Unspent Transaction Outputs - the way Bitcoin actually tracks ownership.
-   **Transaction Inputs:** References to previous transaction outputs.
-   **Transaction Outputs:** New owners and amounts.
-   **Digital Signatures:** Cryptographic proof of ownership.
-   **Transaction Validation:** Ensuring transactions are legitimate.
-   **Mining with Real Transactions:** Miners collect and validate transactions.

This is the most complete implementation that demonstrates how Bitcoin actually works.
