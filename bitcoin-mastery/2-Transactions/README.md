# Module 2: Transactions

## Concept

This module demonstrates how Bitcoin transactions work as a chain of digital signatures.

-   **Transaction:** A record that transfers ownership from one public key to another.
-   **Input:** A reference to a previous transaction output (where you received coins).
-   **Output:** Specifies who will receive the coins and how much.
-   **Chain of Ownership:** Each transaction references the previous one, creating an unbroken chain of ownership.

The key insight: a "coin" is not a single entity, but rather the entire history of transactions that led to the current owner.
