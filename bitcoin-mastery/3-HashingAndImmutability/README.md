# Module 3: Hashing & Immutability

## Concept

This module demonstrates how cryptographic hashing creates immutability in blockchain systems.

-   **Hash Function:** A mathematical function that takes any input and produces a fixed-size string of characters (the hash).
-   **Deterministic:** The same input always produces the same hash.
-   **Avalanche Effect:** A tiny change in input produces a completely different hash.
-   **One-Way Function:** It's computationally infeasible to reverse a hash back to its original input.
-   **Chain of Hashes:** By including the previous block's hash in the current block, we create an immutable chain.

## How to Run

Navigate to this directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
node main.js
```
