# Module 4: Proof-of-Work (Mining)

## Concept

This module implements the Proof-of-Work mechanism that secures Bitcoin.

-   **Mining:** The process of finding a hash that meets specific criteria (difficulty target).
-   **Nonce:** A number that miners change to try different hash outputs.
-   **Difficulty:** How many leading zeros the hash must have.
-   **Security:** The computational work required makes it expensive to attack the network.

This builds directly on the assignments you've already completed, but now integrates it into a full blockchain system.

## How to Run

Navigate to this directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
node main.js
```

Note: This will start mining blocks. Press Ctrl+C to stop when you want to see the results.
