# Bitcoin Mastery - Complete Learning Path

## Overview

This comprehensive learning path covers all core concepts from the Bitcoin whitepaper through hands-on coding. Each module builds upon the previous one, creating a complete understanding of how Bitcoin works.

## Modules

### 1. Keys & Digital Signatures (`1-KeysAndSignatures/`)
**Foundation of ownership in cryptocurrency**
- Generate public/private key pairs
- Create and verify digital signatures
- Understand cryptographic proof of ownership

### 2. Transactions (`2-Transactions/`)
**How ownership is transferred**
- Chain of digital signatures
- Transaction creation and validation
- Understanding the "coin as a chain" concept

### 3. Hashing & Immutability (`3-HashingAndImmutability/`)
**The foundation of blockchain security**
- SHA-256 hashing properties
- Creating immutable chains
- Detecting tampering attempts

### 4. Proof-of-Work (`4-ProofOfWork/`)
**The mining process that secures the network**
- Mining algorithm implementation
- Difficulty adjustment
- Mining rewards and incentives

### 5. Full Transaction System (`5-FullTransactionSystem/`)
**Complete Bitcoin-like implementation**
- UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model
- Transaction inputs and outputs
- Complete blockchain with validation

### 6. Merkle Trees (`6-MerkleTrees/`)
**Efficient transaction verification**
- Merkle tree construction
- Merkle proofs
- SPV (Simplified Payment Verification)

## How to Use This Learning Path

1. **Read the README** in each module directory first
2. **Study the code** in `main.js` - it's heavily commented
3. **Run the code** to see the concepts in action
4. **Experiment** - modify the code to test your understanding

## Running the Code

Navigate to any module directory and run:
```bash
cd [module-directory]
node main.js
```

For example:
```bash
cd 1-KeysAndSignatures
node main.js
```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system
- Basic understanding of JavaScript
- Curiosity about how Bitcoin works!
