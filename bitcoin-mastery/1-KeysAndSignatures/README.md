# Module 1: Keys & Digital Signatures

## Concept

This module covers the foundation of ownership in cryptocurrencies: public-key cryptography.

-   **Private Key:** A secret number that allows you to spend your coins. You must keep this safe.
-   **Public Key:** A number derived from your private key that you can share with others. It acts as your receiving address.
-   **Digital Signature:** A cryptographic proof that a transaction was approved by the owner of the private key.

This script demonstrates how to generate keys, sign a piece of data (a "message"), and verify that the signature is valid.
