# Module 5: Flashloan Strategies ðŸ’¥

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

Master flashloan-based MEV strategies - the most capital-efficient form of value extraction. Learn to execute complex arbitrage and liquidation strategies without holding any initial capital.

## ðŸ“š What You'll Learn

### Core Concepts
- **Flashloan Mechanics** - Borrowing and repaying in single transaction
- **Atomic Arbitrage** - Risk-free profit extraction
- **Capital Efficiency** - Maximum leverage with zero capital
- **Complex Strategies** - Multi-hop arbitrage and liquidations

### Flashloan Providers
1. **Aave** - Largest provider, 0.09% fee
2. **dYdX** - No fees, limited asset selection
3. **Uniswap V3** - 0.05% fee, concentrated liquidity
4. **Balancer** - 0.1% fee, multi-asset flashloans

## ðŸ’¡ Strategy Types

### 1. Arbitrage Flashloans
```
1. Flashloan 1000 ETH from Aave
2. Buy ETH cheap on Uniswap â†’ 1005 ETH
3. Sell ETH expensive on SushiSwap â†’ 1010 ETH
4. Repay 1000.9 ETH to Aave (0.09% fee)
5. Keep 9.1 ETH profit
```

### 2. Liquidation Flashloans
```
1. Flashloan USDC to liquidate undercollateralized position
2. Liquidate borrower, receive discounted collateral
3. Sell collateral for USDC at market price
4. Repay flashloan + fee
5. Keep liquidation bonus as profit
```

### 3. Collateral Swap
```
1. Flashloan new collateral type
2. Deposit as collateral, borrow against it
3. Repay old debt, withdraw old collateral
4. Sell old collateral, repay flashloan
5. Net: Swapped collateral types in one transaction
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Architecture
```solidity
contract FlashloanArbitrage {
    function executeFlashloan(
        address asset,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata params
    ) external {
        // Request flashloan
        LENDING_POOL.flashLoan(asset, amount, params);
    }
    
    function executeOperation(
        address asset,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 premium,
        bytes calldata params
    ) external {
        // Execute arbitrage strategy
        // Must repay amount + premium
    }
}
```

### Risk Management
- **Slippage Protection** - Ensure profitable execution
- **Gas Estimation** - Prevent out-of-gas failures
- **Revert Protection** - Handle failed strategies gracefully
- **MEV Competition** - Protect against front-running

## ðŸ“Š Performance Metrics

### Success Factors
- **Speed** - Fast execution beats competition
- **Capital Efficiency** - High returns per gas spent
- **Strategy Complexity** - More sophisticated = higher profits
- **Market Coverage** - Monitor multiple opportunities

### Risk Factors
- **Smart Contract Risk** - Bugs in complex strategies
- **Market Risk** - Price movements during execution
- **Competition Risk** - Other bots copying strategies
- **Gas Risk** - High network congestion

## ðŸš€ Advanced Strategies

### Multi-Protocol Arbitrage
- **Cross-DEX** - Exploit price differences across exchanges
- **Cross-Chain** - Bridge assets for arbitrage opportunities
- **Yield Farming** - Harvest and compound rewards efficiently

### MEV Combinations
- **Sandwich + Flashloan** - Amplify sandwich attack profits
- **Liquidation Clusters** - Liquidate multiple positions
- **Statistical Arbitrage** - Mean reversion strategies
