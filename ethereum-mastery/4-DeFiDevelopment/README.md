# Module 4: DeFi Development

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand DeFi protocols and their components
- Learn to build decentralized exchanges (DEX)
- Implement lending and borrowing protocols
- Create liquidity pools and automated market makers (AMM)
- Develop yield farming and staking mechanisms
- Integrate with existing DeFi protocols (Uniswap, Compound, Aave)

## 📚 Core Concepts

### DeFi Fundamentals
- **Decentralized Finance**: Financial services without traditional intermediaries
- **Composability**: Building blocks that can be combined
- **Liquidity**: Available capital for trading and lending
- **Yield**: Returns generated from DeFi activities

### Key DeFi Protocols
1. **Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)**
   - Automated Market Makers (AMM)
   - Order book-based exchanges
   - Liquidity pools and swaps

2. **Lending Protocols**
   - Collateralized lending
   - Interest rate models
   - Liquidation mechanisms

3. **Yield Farming**
   - Liquidity mining
   - Reward distribution
   - Token incentives

### Mathematical Models
- **Constant Product Formula**: x * y = k (Uniswap)
- **Interest Rate Models**: Supply and demand curves
- **Liquidation Ratios**: Collateral vs debt thresholds

## 🔧 Practical Implementation

### Prerequisites
```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts @uniswap/v2-core @uniswap/v2-periphery
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers
```

### DeFi Protocols We'll Build
1. **SimpleAMM** - Basic automated market maker
2. **LendingPool** - Collateralized lending protocol
3. **YieldFarm** - Staking and reward distribution
4. **FlashLoan** - Uncollateralized instant loans
5. **DeFiComposer** - Protocol integration examples

### Key Features Implemented
- Liquidity provision and removal
- Token swapping with fees
- Interest accrual mechanisms
- Liquidation and risk management
- Governance token distribution

## 🚀 Running the Code

```bash
cd 4-DeFiDevelopment
npm install
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
node main.js
```

## 🔍 What You'll Learn
- DeFi protocol architecture and design patterns
- Mathematical models behind AMMs and lending
- Risk management and liquidation mechanisms
- Protocol composability and integration
- Economic incentives and tokenomics
- Flash loans and arbitrage opportunities
