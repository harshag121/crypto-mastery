# Module 3: Smart Contract Development

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Master advanced smart contract development patterns
- Learn to use Hardhat for development, testing, and deployment
- Understand contract compilation, artifacts, and ABIs
- Practice testing strategies and test-driven development
- Deploy contracts to testnets and interact with them
- Implement common design patterns and best practices

## 📚 Core Concepts

### Development Environment Setup
- **Hardhat**: Ethereum development environment
- **Solidity Compiler**: Contract compilation and optimization
- **Testing Framework**: Mocha, Chai, and Waffle
- **Network Configuration**: Local, testnet, and mainnet setup

### Smart Contract Lifecycle
1. **Design**: Architecture and requirements
2. **Development**: Writing and testing contracts
3. **Compilation**: Bytecode generation and optimization
4. **Testing**: Unit and integration tests
5. **Deployment**: Testnet and mainnet deployment
6. **Verification**: Source code verification on block explorers
7. **Interaction**: Frontend integration and API development

### Design Patterns
- **Access Control**: Owner, role-based permissions
- **Upgradeable Contracts**: Proxy patterns
- **Factory Pattern**: Contract creation and management
- **State Machine**: Complex state transitions
- **Pull over Push**: Payment and withdrawal patterns

### Testing Strategies
- **Unit Testing**: Individual function testing
- **Integration Testing**: Contract interaction testing
- **Gas Testing**: Optimization and cost analysis
- **Security Testing**: Vulnerability assessment

## 🔧 Practical Implementation

### Prerequisites
```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle
npm install --save-dev @openzeppelin/contracts @openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades
```

### Smart Contracts We'll Build
1. **TokenFactory** - Deploy multiple token contracts
2. **MultiSigWallet** - Multi-signature wallet implementation
3. **TimeLock** - Time-locked contract execution
4. **UpgradeableToken** - Proxy-based upgradeable contract
5. **DecentralizedExchange** - Simple DEX implementation

### Development Tools Used
- Hardhat for development environment
- OpenZeppelin for secure contract templates
- Ethers.js for contract interaction
- Waffle for advanced testing features
- Hardhat Network for local blockchain simulation

## 🚀 Running the Code

```bash
cd 3-SmartContractDevelopment
npm install
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node --hostname 0.0.0.0
node main.js
```
