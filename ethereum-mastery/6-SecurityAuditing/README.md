# Module 6: Security and Auditing

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Master smart contract security vulnerabilities and attack vectors
- Learn security analysis tools and methodologies
- Understand formal verification and testing strategies
- Practice security auditing techniques
- Implement security best practices and design patterns
- Develop incident response and emergency procedures

## 📚 Core Concepts

### Common Vulnerabilities
- **Reentrancy**: External calls allowing state manipulation
- **Integer Overflow/Underflow**: Arithmetic errors (pre-Solidity 0.8)
- **Access Control**: Unauthorized function execution
- **Front-running**: MEV and transaction ordering attacks
- **Oracle Manipulation**: Price feed and data source attacks

### Security Tools
- **Static Analysis**: Slither, MythX, Semgrep
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Echidna, Manticore, Foundry
- **Formal Verification**: Certora, TLA+, K Framework
- **Gas Analysis**: Hardhat Gas Reporter, ETH Gas Station

## 🔧 Practical Implementation

### Prerequisites
```bash
npm install --save-dev slither-analyzer mythx-cli
pip install slither-analyzer
```

### Security Projects We'll Analyze
1. **VulnerableContract** - Common vulnerability examples
2. **SecureContract** - Properly secured implementations
3. **AuditChecklist** - Comprehensive security review process
4. **EmergencyResponse** - Circuit breakers and pause mechanisms
5. **GasOptimization** - Security-conscious gas optimization

## 🚀 Running the Code

```bash
cd 6-SecurityAuditing
npm install
slither . --print human-summary
node main.js
```

## 🔍 What You'll Learn
- Comprehensive vulnerability identification and mitigation
- Security tool usage and analysis interpretation
- Audit methodology and reporting
- Emergency response procedures
- Gas optimization without compromising security
- Formal verification techniques
