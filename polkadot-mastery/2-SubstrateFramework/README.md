# Module 2: Substrate Framework

## Overview
Master the Substrate blockchain development framework, the foundation that powers Polkadot and its parachains. Learn to build custom blockchains with modular pallets, efficient storage systems, and powerful runtime capabilities.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Substrate's modular architecture and design principles
- Build custom runtime modules (pallets) from scratch
- Implement efficient storage patterns and state management
- Master extrinsic handling and event emission
- Deploy and test Substrate-based blockchains
- Integrate off-chain workers for external data processing

## Key Concepts

### 1. Substrate Architecture
- **Runtime**: The state transition function defining blockchain logic
- **Node**: Networking, consensus, and RPC layers
- **Pallets**: Modular runtime components with specific functionality
- **FRAME**: Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities

### 2. Runtime Development
- **Storage Items**: On-chain state management patterns
- **Dispatchable Functions**: Transaction entry points
- **Events**: Notification system for state changes
- **Errors**: Comprehensive error handling
- **Hooks**: Lifecycle management and automation

### 3. Storage Patterns
- **Storage Value**: Single value storage
- **Storage Map**: Key-value mapping storage
- **Storage Double Map**: Two-key mapping storage
- **Storage N Map**: Multi-key mapping storage
- **Bounded Collections**: Memory-safe collections

### 4. Consensus Integration
- **AURA**: Authority-based round-robin consensus
- **BABE**: Blind assignment for block extension
- **GRANDPA**: Finality gadget integration
- **Custom Consensus**: Building specialized consensus mechanisms
