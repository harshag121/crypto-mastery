# Module 6: Advanced Solana Topics 🚀

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand Solana's staking and validator economics
- Explore governance mechanisms and voting
- Learn about MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)
- Master Cross-Program Invocation (CPI)
- Dive into Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)
- Understand Solana's fee structure and priority fees
- Explore advanced account models and rent exemption

## 🏗️ Advanced Architecture Concepts

### 1. **Validators & Staking** 🔐
- **Proof of Stake consensus** - Energy efficient vs Bitcoin's PoW
- **Validator nodes** - Process transactions and secure network
- **Stake delegation** - Users delegate SOL to validators
- **Rewards & slashing** - Economic incentives and penalties
- **Epoch system** - ~2-3 day cycles for rewards distribution

### 2. **Governance** 🗳️
- **On-chain governance** - Protocol upgrades via voting
- **Governance tokens** - Decision-making power distribution  
- **Proposal lifecycle** - Creation, voting, execution
- **Multisig accounts** - Shared control mechanisms
- **DAO patterns** - Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

### 3. **MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)** ⚡
- **Arbitrage opportunities** - Price differences across DEXs
- **Liquidation bots** - Automated liquidation of risky positions
- **Front-running** - Transaction ordering manipulation
- **Sandwich attacks** - Profit from user transactions
- **Priority fees** - Pay more for faster inclusion

### 4. **Cross-Program Invocation (CPI)** 🔗
- **Program composition** - Programs calling other programs
- **Instruction forwarding** - Passing instructions between programs
- **Account sharing** - Multiple programs accessing same accounts
- **Security considerations** - Trust boundaries and validation

### 5. **Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)** 🎯
- **Deterministic addresses** - Addresses without private keys
- **Seed-based generation** - Predictable account creation
- **Program ownership** - Programs owning accounts
- **Data storage patterns** - Structured on-chain data

### 6. **Fee Structure & Optimization** 💰
- **Base fees** - Standard transaction costs (~5000 lamports)
- **Priority fees** - Additional fees for faster processing
- **Compute units** - Measuring program execution cost
- **Rent exemption** - Minimum balance requirements
- **Fee optimization** - Strategies to minimize costs
