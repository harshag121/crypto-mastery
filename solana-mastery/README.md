# Solana Mastery - Complete Learning Path

## Overview

This comprehensive learning path covers Solana development from basics to advanced concepts. Solana is a high-performance blockchain that supports smart contracts and uses Proof of History consensus.

## Key Differences from Bitcoin

- **Speed:** 65,000+ TPS vs Bitcoin's ~7 TPS
- **Smart Contracts:** Programs that run on the blockchain
- **Account Model:** vs Bitcoin's UTXO model
- **Consensus:** Proof of History + Proof of Stake vs Proof of Work
- **Programming:** Rust/C/C++ vs Bitcoin Script
